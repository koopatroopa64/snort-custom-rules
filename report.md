# Final Report: Snort Custom Rules Project

## 🎯 Objective
Design and test a suite of custom Snort IDS rules in a Kali Linux environment to detect various types of potentially malicious network behavior. This project demonstrates practical understanding of intrusion detection logic, traffic analysis, and rule development.

## 🧪 Environment
- **OS:** Kali Linux (VM)
- **Snort Version:** 2.9.20
- **Tools Used:** Nmap, Ping, curl, netcat, browser, Python HTTP server, FTP server
- **Testing Mode:** IDS using `-i lo` or `-i eth0`, `-A fast`, and alert logging to custom paths

## 📷 Screenshots
Screenshots for each alert and simulation are located in the `/screenshots/` folder and referenced from their respective test cases.

Example:
![Nmap TCP SYN Scan](screenshots/nmap_test.png)

## 📂 Test Cases
Each rule is documented and tested in its own Markdown file inside the `/test_cases/` directory. Test steps, simulation methods, and Snort output are included.

Examples:
- `test_icmp.md`
- `test_nmap.md`
- `test_ssh_bruteforce.md`
- `test_http_get.md`
- …

## ✅ Results
- **All 14 rules** successfully triggered alerts in controlled test conditions.
- Logs saved under `/logs/alerts_<name>.txt`
- Each test is reproducible with clear, repeatable instructions.

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
- Developed deep understanding of Snort rule writing and syntax
- Gained hands-on experience simulating network attacks across multiple protocols
- Practiced tuning detection rules to avoid false positives and ensure hits
- Built a functional and reusable Snort test lab

## 🔗 Future Improvements
- Expand to IPS testing (inline mode)
- Add Python automation for log parsing and rule validation
- Integrate Wireshark for dual-layer traffic analysis
- Build dashboards for alert visualization using ELK or Splunk
